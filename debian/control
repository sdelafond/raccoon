Description: Python DataFrame with fast insert and appends (Python 3)
 Lightweight DataFrame and Series implementation inspired by the
 phenomenal Pandas package for the one use case where Pandas is known
 to be sub-optimal: DataFrames that grow in size by rows frequently in
 the code. Additionally Raccoon DataFrames can be parametrized to be
 sorted so that additions to the DataFrame keep the index in sorted
 order to speed inserts and retrievals.
